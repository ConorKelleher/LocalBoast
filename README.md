# What is it?

**LocalBoast** is a React library developed with a view to creating spectacle with as little effort as possible. If something doesn't sound very practical but would probably look cool, it belongs here.

The intention is to remain with zero dependencies (other than some borrowed code here and there) so a lot of the library consists of common functions from other repos (function debouncing, resize detection etc.) but with an API that's custom-built to work with the flashier parts of this library. So yes, some wheels are being reinvented in the name of creating a pointlessly flashy car but, in fairness, most wheels are boring.

Install the entire module as a dependency from npm as normal:

```bash
npm i localboast
# or
yarn add localboast
```

**Note**: As this library is intended to be all-inclusive, it has no dependencies other than peer-dependencies of `react` and `react-dom`. This means it should have minimal compatibility issues with any app.

# To Use

This library includes a range of [**Components**](https://github.com/ConorKelleher/localboast/tree/main/src/components), [**Hooks**](https://github.com/ConorKelleher/localboast/tree/main/src/hooks) and [**Utils**](https://github.com/ConorKelleher/localboast/tree/main/src/utils). These are all able to be used independently and are intended to provide quick access to powerful functionality.

All public elements of this library are exported from the root index, allowing for simple imports like:

```javascript
import { Truncate, useMove, debounce } from "localboast"
```

Each of the core folders also provides an index of the exported contents, potentially saving on some unneeded imports:

```javascript
import { Truncate } from "localboast/components"
import { useMove } from "localboast/hooks"
import { debounce } from "localboast/utils"
```

Each module can also be imported directly from their own folder, allowing for largest optimization:

```javascript
import Truncate from "localboast/components/Truncate"
import useMove from "localboast/hooks/useMove"
import debounce from "localboast/utils/debounce"
```

## Docs/Example

This library is developed and documented through storybook.
A static build of this storybook app can be found at https://LocalBoast.com/docs
(Note: that entire website is built as a showcase of sorts for the LocalBoast library, but the `/docs` route is a direct embed of the full storybook app).

While I intend on keeping the above public build up to date with the functionality of this library, I cannot guarantee that it'll always be up to date. If you need docs for the latest and greatest, you can run it locally by cloning this repository and running `yarn run storybook`

## Live Development

In an attempt to be somewhat unique, the development of this project is largely happening live on stream over on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/localboast) or on [YouTube Live](http://youtube.com/channel/UCt-IaL4qQsOU6_rbS7zky1Q/live). A record of all past live streams and other video documentation can also be found at the above YouTube channel.

## Donations

I'm working on this instead of having a job that pays me. So for the time being, I'm going to be funded through generosity alone. If you're feeling generous, here are some links:

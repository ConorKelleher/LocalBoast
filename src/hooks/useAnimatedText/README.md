<h1>useAnimatedText</h1>
Hook to allow per-character animating of any string. Simply pass in a string and the component will return a self-updating string animating each character that is different from the previous provided value.
<br>

See the component-based solution: [AnimatedText](https://github.com/conorkelleher/localboast/tree/main/src/components/AnimatedText)<br><h4>See [examples and full documentation](https://localboast.com/docs?path=/docs/hooks-useanimatedtext--docs)</h4>

Install the entire module as a dependency from npm as normal:

```bash
npm i localboast
# or
yarn add localboast
```

**Note**: As this library is intended to be all-inclusive, it has no dependencies other than peer-dependencies of `react` and `react-dom`. This means it should have minimal compatibility issues with any app.

## Usage

```javascript
import useAnimatedText from "localboast/hooks/useAnimatedText"
import useInterval from "localboast/hooks/useInterval"
import { useState } from "react"

const texts = ["This is the first string", "This is the second string"]

const SomeComponent = () => {
  const [textIndex, setTextIndex] = useState(0)
  const textToAnimate = texts[textIndex]
  const animatingString = useAnimatedText(textToAnimate)

  useInterval(() => {
    setTextIndex((oldIndex) => (oldIndex + 1) % texts.length)
  }, 5000)

  return <p>{animatingString}</p>
}

```
## Docs/Example

This library is developed and documented through storybook.
A static build of this storybook app can be found at https://LocalBoast.com/docs
(Note: that entire website is built as a showcase of sorts for the LocalBoast library, but the `/docs` route is a direct embed of the full storybook app).

While I intend on keeping the above public build up to date with the functionality of this library, I cannot guarantee that it'll always be up to date. If you need docs for the latest and greatest, you can run it locally by cloning this repository and running `yarn run storybook`

## Live Development

In an attempt to be somewhat unique, the development of this project is largely happening live on stream over on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/localboast) or on [YouTube Live](http://youtube.com/channel/UCt-IaL4qQsOU6_rbS7zky1Q/live). A record of all past live streams and other video documentation can also be found at the above YouTube channel.

## Donations

I'm working on this instead of having a job that pays me. So for the time being, I'm going to be funded through generosity alone. If you're feeling generous, here are some links:

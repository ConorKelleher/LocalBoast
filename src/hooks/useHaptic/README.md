<h1>useHaptic</h1>
Hook to add visual feedback to an interactive component. Returns styles and event handlers to provide to an element to allow scaling up on hover/focus and a "pop" smaller when clicked/pressed.
<br>

See the component-based solution: [Haptic](https://github.com/conorkelleher/localboast/tree/main/src/components/Haptic)<br><h4>See [examples and full documentation](https://localboast.com/docs?path=/docs/hooks-usehaptic--docs)</h4>

Install the entire module as a dependency from npm as normal:

```bash
npm i localboast
# or
yarn add localboast
```

**Note**: As this library is intended to be all-inclusive, it has no dependencies other than peer-dependencies of `react` and `react-dom`. This means it should have minimal compatibility issues with any app.

## Usage

```javascript
import { ActionIcon, Button, Group } from "@mantine/core"
import { IconRocket } from "@tabler/icons-react"
import useHaptic, {
  USE_HAPTIC_DEFAULT_OPTIONS,
  UseHapticOptions,
} from "localboast/hooks/useHaptic"

const UseHapticDemo = (props: UseHapticOptions) => {
  const [hapticProps1] = useHaptic(props)

  const [hapticProps2] = useHaptic({
    ...props,
    events: { focus: true, click: false },
  })

  const [hapticProps3] = useHaptic({
    ...props,
    events: { focus: false, click: true },
  })

  return (
    <Group>
      <div
        {...hapticProps1}
        style={{ cursor: "pointer", ...hapticProps1.style }}
      >
        <ActionIcon size="lg" style={{ pointerEvents: "none" }}>
          <IconRocket />
        </ActionIcon>
      </div>

      <div
        {...hapticProps2}
        style={{ cursor: "pointer", ...hapticProps2.style }}
      >
        <Button style={{ pointerEvents: "none" }}>
          Haptic on focus but not click
        </Button>
      </div>

      <div
        {...hapticProps3}
        style={{ cursor: "pointer", ...hapticProps3.style }}
      >
        <Button style={{ pointerEvents: "none" }}>
          Haptic on click but not focus
        </Button>
      </div>
    </Group>
  )
}

UseHapticDemo.defaultProps = USE_HAPTIC_DEFAULT_OPTIONS

export default UseHapticDemo

```
## Docs/Example

This library is developed and documented through storybook.
A static build of this storybook app can be found at https://LocalBoast.com/docs
(Note: that entire website is built as a showcase of sorts for the LocalBoast library, but the `/docs` route is a direct embed of the full storybook app).

While I intend on keeping the above public build up to date with the functionality of this library, I cannot guarantee that it'll always be up to date. If you need docs for the latest and greatest, you can run it locally by cloning this repository and running `yarn run storybook`

## Live Development

In an attempt to be somewhat unique, the development of this project is largely happening live on stream over on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/localboast) or on [YouTube Live](http://youtube.com/channel/UCt-IaL4qQsOU6_rbS7zky1Q/live). A record of all past live streams and other video documentation can also be found at the above YouTube channel.

## Donations

I'm working on this instead of having a job that pays me. So for the time being, I'm going to be funded through generosity alone. If you're feeling generous, here are some links:

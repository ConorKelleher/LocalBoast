# LocalBoast - Hooks

Install the entire module as a dependency from npm as normal:

```bash
npm i localboast
# or
yarn add localboast
```

**Note**: As this library is intended to be all-inclusive, it has no dependencies other than peer-dependencies of `react` and `react-dom`. This means it should have minimal compatibility issues with any app.

# To Use

Each of the links in the [Contents](#contents) table above has a dedicated Readme explaining usage of the particular function.

All of these hooks are exported from the root index, allowing for simple imports like:

```javascript
import { useMove } from "localboast"
```

They can also be imported directly from the `hooks` directory like:

```javascript
import { useMove } from "localboast/hooks"
```

The specific file can also be imported directly for most optimization

```javascript
import useMove from "localboast/hooks/useMove
```

## Docs/Example

This library is developed and documented through storybook.
A static build of this storybook app can be found at https://LocalBoast.com/docs
(Note: that entire website is built as a showcase of sorts for the LocalBoast library, but the `/docs` route is a direct embed of the full storybook app).

While I intend on keeping the above public build up to date with the functionality of this library, I cannot guarantee that it'll always be up to date. If you need docs for the latest and greatest, you can run it locally by cloning this repository and running `yarn run storybook`

## Live Development

In an attempt to be somewhat unique, the development of this project is largely happening live on stream over on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/localboast) or on [YouTube Live](http://youtube.com/channel/UCt-IaL4qQsOU6_rbS7zky1Q/live). A record of all past live streams and other video documentation can also be found at the above YouTube channel.

## Donations

I'm working on this instead of having a job that pays me. So for the time being, I'm going to be funded through generosity alone. If you're feeling generous, here are some links:

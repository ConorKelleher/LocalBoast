<h1>useDelayedValue</h1>
Nifty little hook to add a delay when changing a value. When the provided value changes, automatically creates a self-cleaning timeout to update its local state (which is then returned).
  
  Useful for providing visual delays in response to state changes, e.g.:

  ```javascript
  const [showThankYouPrompt] = useDelayedValue(hasAllowedCookies)
  ```
  
  <p>Provides multiple back-doors for setting state immediately. The returned value is an array where the first value is the delayed value and the second value is a function that cancels the timeout and syncs the values immediately.
  There is also an optional `immediateIf` function that can be provided to determine when to bypass the timeout, e.g.:</p>
  
  ```javascript
  const [modalOpen] = useDelayedValue(showFeedback, { immediateIf: (value) => value === false })
  ```

<h4>See [examples and full documentation](https://localboast.com/docs?path=/docs/hooks-usedelayedvalue--docs)</h4>

Install the entire module as a dependency from npm as normal:

```bash
npm i localboast
# or
yarn add localboast
```

**Note**: As this library is intended to be all-inclusive, it has no dependencies other than peer-dependencies of `react` and `react-dom`. This means it should have minimal compatibility issues with any app.

## Usage

```javascript
import { Button, Stack, Text } from "@mantine/core"
import useDelayedValue, {
  USE_DELAYED_VALUE_DEFAULT_OPTIONS,
  UseDelayedValueOptions,
} from "../../useDelayedValue"

interface UseDelayedValueDemoProps extends UseDelayedValueOptions {
  value: any
}

const UseDelayedValueDemo = ({
  value,
  ...options
}: UseDelayedValueDemoProps) => {
  const [delayedValue, setImmediate] = useDelayedValue(value, options)

  return (
    <Stack justify="center" align="center">
      <Text>
        Update the value in the controls section, and notice it doesn't update
        here until a delay.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Value is: <strong>{value}</strong>
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Delayed value is: <strong>{delayedValue}</strong>
      </Text>
      <Button onClick={setImmediate}>Sync immediate</Button>
    </Stack>
  )
}

UseDelayedValueDemo.defaultProps = {
  ...USE_DELAYED_VALUE_DEFAULT_OPTIONS,
}

export default UseDelayedValueDemo

```
## Docs/Example

This library is developed and documented through storybook.
A static build of this storybook app can be found at https://LocalBoast.com/docs
(Note: that entire website is built as a showcase of sorts for the LocalBoast library, but the `/docs` route is a direct embed of the full storybook app).

While I intend on keeping the above public build up to date with the functionality of this library, I cannot guarantee that it'll always be up to date. If you need docs for the latest and greatest, you can run it locally by cloning this repository and running `yarn run storybook`

## Live Development

In an attempt to be somewhat unique, the development of this project is largely happening live on stream over on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/localboast) or on [YouTube Live](http://youtube.com/channel/UCt-IaL4qQsOU6_rbS7zky1Q/live). A record of all past live streams and other video documentation can also be found at the above YouTube channel.

## Donations

I'm working on this instead of having a job that pays me. So for the time being, I'm going to be funded through generosity alone. If you're feeling generous, here are some links:

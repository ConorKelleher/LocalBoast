# To Use

Each of the links in the [Contents](#contents) table above has a dedicated Readme explaining usage of the particular function.

All of these utils are exported from the root index, allowing for simple imports like:

```javascript
import { debounce } from "localboast"
```

They can also be imported directly from the `utils` directory like:

```javascript
import { debounce } from "localboast/utils"
```

The specific file can also be imported directly for most optimization

```javascript
import debounce from "localboast/utils/debounce
```

<h1>cx</h1>
Function to concatenate one or more class names. Takes a variable number of arguments that are each either a string or an object, where the keys are conditional class names and the value's truthiness determines whether or not it should be concatenated.
<br>

<h4>See [examples and full documentation](https://localboast.com/docs?path=/docs/utils-cx--docs)</h4>

Install the entire module as a dependency from npm as normal:

```bash
npm i localboast
# or
yarn add localboast
```

**Note**: As this library is intended to be all-inclusive, it has no dependencies other than peer-dependencies of `react` and `react-dom`. This means it should have minimal compatibility issues with any app.

## Usage

```javascript
import cx from "localboast/utils/cx"

const SomeComponent = ({
  disabled,
  primary,
}: {
  disabled: boolean
  primary: boolean
}) => {
  return (
    <button
      className={cx("button-class", {
        ["button-disabled"]: disabled,
        ["button-primary"]: primary,
      })}
    >
      Click Me
    </button>
  )
}

```
## Docs/Example

This library is developed and documented through storybook.
A static build of this storybook app can be found at https://LocalBoast.com/docs
(Note: that entire website is built as a showcase of sorts for the LocalBoast library, but the `/docs` route is a direct embed of the full storybook app).

While I intend on keeping the above public build up to date with the functionality of this library, I cannot guarantee that it'll always be up to date. If you need docs for the latest and greatest, you can run it locally by cloning this repository and running `yarn run storybook`

## Live Development

In an attempt to be somewhat unique, the development of this project is largely happening live on stream over on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/localboast) or on [YouTube Live](http://youtube.com/channel/UCt-IaL4qQsOU6_rbS7zky1Q/live). A record of all past live streams and other video documentation can also be found at the above YouTube channel.

## Donations

I'm working on this instead of having a job that pays me. So for the time being, I'm going to be funded through generosity alone. If you're feeling generous, here are some links:

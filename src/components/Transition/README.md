<h1>Transition</h1>
Component to add transitions to a JSX tag. Supports polymorphism to avoid adding additional wrapper divs.<br>
  This wraps the <strong>useTransition</strong> hook to allow ease-of use with JSX.
<br>

See the hook-based solution: [useTransition](https://github.com/conorkelleher/localboast/tree/main/src/hooks/useTransition)<br><h4>See [examples and full documentation](https://localboast.com/docs?path=/docs/components-transition--docs)</h4>

Install the entire module as a dependency from npm as normal:

```bash
npm i localboast
# or
yarn add localboast
```

**Note**: As this library is intended to be all-inclusive, it has no dependencies other than peer-dependencies of `react` and `react-dom`. This means it should have minimal compatibility issues with any app.

## Usage

```javascript
import Transition, { TransitionProps } from "localboast/components/Transition"
import { generateRandomId } from "localboast/utils"
import { useState } from "react"

const TransitionDemo = (props: TransitionProps) => {
  const [instanceIndex, setInstanceIndex] = useState(0)
  const [enabled, setEnabled] = useState(true)
  const checkboxId = `transitionDemoToggle_${generateRandomId()}`
  return (
    <div
      style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row", alignItems: "center" }}
    >
      <Transition key={instanceIndex} {...props} shouldTransition={enabled} />
      <div
        style={{
          display: "flex",
          flexDirection: "column",
          alignItems: "center",
          justifyContent: "center",
        }}
      >
        <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row", gap: 10 }}>
          <label htmlFor={checkboxId}>Transition Enabled?</label>
          <input
            id={checkboxId}
            type="checkbox"
            checked={enabled}
            onChange={(e) => setEnabled(e.target.checked)}
          />
        </div>
        <button
          style={{ marginLeft: 30 }}
          onClick={() => setInstanceIndex((oldIndex) => oldIndex + 1)}
        >
          Reset
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

TransitionDemo.defaultProps = Transition.defaultProps
export type TransitionDemo = typeof Transition

export default TransitionDemo

```
## Docs/Example

This library is developed and documented through storybook.
A static build of this storybook app can be found at https://LocalBoast.com/docs
(Note: that entire website is built as a showcase of sorts for the LocalBoast library, but the `/docs` route is a direct embed of the full storybook app).

While I intend on keeping the above public build up to date with the functionality of this library, I cannot guarantee that it'll always be up to date. If you need docs for the latest and greatest, you can run it locally by cloning this repository and running `yarn run storybook`

## Live Development

In an attempt to be somewhat unique, the development of this project is largely happening live on stream over on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/localboast) or on [YouTube Live](http://youtube.com/channel/UCt-IaL4qQsOU6_rbS7zky1Q/live). A record of all past live streams and other video documentation can also be found at the above YouTube channel.

## Donations

I'm working on this instead of having a job that pays me. So for the time being, I'm going to be funded through generosity alone. If you're feeling generous, here are some links:

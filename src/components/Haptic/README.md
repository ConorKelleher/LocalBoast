<h1>Haptic</h1>
Component to add visual feedback to an interactive component. Child elements will scale up on hover/focus and pop smaller when clicked/pressed.
<br>

See the hook-based solution: [useHaptic](https://github.com/conorkelleher/localboast/tree/main/src/hooks/useHaptic)<br><h4>See [examples and full documentation](https://localboast.com/docs?path=/docs/components-haptic--docs)</h4>

Install the entire module as a dependency from npm as normal:

```bash
npm i localboast
# or
yarn add localboast
```

**Note**: As this library is intended to be all-inclusive, it has no dependencies other than peer-dependencies of `react` and `react-dom`. This means it should have minimal compatibility issues with any app.

## Usage

```javascript
import { ActionIcon, Button, Group } from "@mantine/core"
import { IconRocket } from "@tabler/icons-react"
import Haptic, {
  HAPTIC_DEFAULT_PROPS,
  HapticProps,
} from "localboast/components/Haptic"

const HapticDemo = (props: HapticProps) => {
  return (
    <Group>
      <Haptic style={{ cursor: "pointer" }} {...props}>
        <ActionIcon size="lg" style={{ pointerEvents: "none" }}>
          <IconRocket />
        </ActionIcon>
      </Haptic>

      <Haptic
        {...props}
        events={{ focus: true, click: false }}
        style={{ cursor: "pointer" }}
      >
        <Button style={{ pointerEvents: "none" }}>
          Haptic on focus but not click
        </Button>
      </Haptic>

      <Haptic
        {...props}
        events={{ focus: false, click: true }}
        style={{ cursor: "pointer" }}
      >
        <Button style={{ pointerEvents: "none" }}>
          Haptic on click but not focus
        </Button>
      </Haptic>
    </Group>
  )
}

HapticDemo.defaultProps = HAPTIC_DEFAULT_PROPS

export default HapticDemo

```
## Docs/Example

This library is developed and documented through storybook.
A static build of this storybook app can be found at https://LocalBoast.com/docs
(Note: that entire website is built as a showcase of sorts for the LocalBoast library, but the `/docs` route is a direct embed of the full storybook app).

While I intend on keeping the above public build up to date with the functionality of this library, I cannot guarantee that it'll always be up to date. If you need docs for the latest and greatest, you can run it locally by cloning this repository and running `yarn run storybook`

## Live Development

In an attempt to be somewhat unique, the development of this project is largely happening live on stream over on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/localboast) or on [YouTube Live](http://youtube.com/channel/UCt-IaL4qQsOU6_rbS7zky1Q/live). A record of all past live streams and other video documentation can also be found at the above YouTube channel.

## Donations

I'm working on this instead of having a job that pays me. So for the time being, I'm going to be funded through generosity alone. If you're feeling generous, here are some links:

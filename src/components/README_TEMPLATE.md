# To Use

Each of the links in the [Contents](#contents) table above has a dedicated Readme explaining usage of the particular function.

All of these components are exported from the root index, allowing for simple imports like:

```javascript
import { Truncate } from "localboast"
```

They can also be imported specifically from the `components` directory like:

```javascript
import { Truncate } from "localboast/components"
```

The specific file can also be imported directly for most optimization

```javascript
import Truncate from "localboast/components/Truncate
```

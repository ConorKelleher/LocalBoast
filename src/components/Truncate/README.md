<h1>Truncate</h1>
Component to allow any rendered string to be programmatically truncated with customizable truncation position, offsets and ellipsis.<br>
  This wraps the <strong>useTruncate</strong> hook to allow ease-of use with JSX.
<br>

See the hook-based solution: [useTruncate](https://github.com/conorkelleher/localboast/tree/main/src/hooks/useTruncate)<br><h4>See [examples and full documentation](https://localboast.com/docs?path=/docs/components-truncate--docs)</h4>

Install the entire module as a dependency from npm as normal:

```bash
npm i localboast
# or
yarn add localboast
```

**Note**: As this library is intended to be all-inclusive, it has no dependencies other than peer-dependencies of `react` and `react-dom`. This means it should have minimal compatibility issues with any app.

## Usage

```javascript
import Truncate from "localboast/components/Truncate"

const files = [
  {
    name: "Copy - my file - 03/03/2024.jpg",
    id: 1,
  },
  {
    name: "Copy - my file - 04/03/2024.jpg",
    id: 2,
  },
  {
    name: "Copy - my file - 05/03/2024.jpg",
    id: 3,
  },
]

// Display all file data with truncation happening 14 chars from the end
// i.e. include full date and extension BEFORE truncation kicks in
const SomeComponent = () => {
  return files.map(({ name, id }) => (
    <Truncate key={`files_${id}`} from="end" endOffset={14}>
      {name}
    </Truncate>
  ))
}

```
## Docs/Example

This library is developed and documented through storybook.
A static build of this storybook app can be found at https://LocalBoast.com/docs
(Note: that entire website is built as a showcase of sorts for the LocalBoast library, but the `/docs` route is a direct embed of the full storybook app).

While I intend on keeping the above public build up to date with the functionality of this library, I cannot guarantee that it'll always be up to date. If you need docs for the latest and greatest, you can run it locally by cloning this repository and running `yarn run storybook`

## Live Development

In an attempt to be somewhat unique, the development of this project is largely happening live on stream over on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/localboast) or on [YouTube Live](http://youtube.com/channel/UCt-IaL4qQsOU6_rbS7zky1Q/live). A record of all past live streams and other video documentation can also be found at the above YouTube channel.

## Donations

I'm working on this instead of having a job that pays me. So for the time being, I'm going to be funded through generosity alone. If you're feeling generous, here are some links:
